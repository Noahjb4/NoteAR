NoteAR

  An augmented reality application created with Unity 2019.3.14f to serve as a communication and information storage platform between workers where relevant information in the form of notes and drawings can be stored. 

Introduction

  This app will serve as an information storage channel between workers. It can serve as both a communication platform and a training platform. Workers between shifts can write notes about their current progress with machine maintenance for example that the next person can load and immediately know the status of the machine, what has been done and what needs to be done. Experience workers can also save instructions within the app regarding frequently encountered problems that newer or less experience workers can access as a guide. 

Features

  Drawings and notes added by the user will be saved to Azure Cloud Storage and can be loaded back into the scene
